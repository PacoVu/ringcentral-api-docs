# Interactive messaging events for Team Messaging

Unlike other outbound events sent by RingCentral, events related to interactive messages do not require the application to explicitly subscribe for a particular set of events. Instead, you will provide an "Outbound webhook URL" when you create your application, to which RingCentral will automatically deliver any event relating to an interactive message posted by that app. 

Interactive messaging events are also unique in that applications are expected to issue a response upon receiving an event that will signal to RingCentral how the system should respond to the event. See "Responding to interactive message events" below. 

## What interactive messaging events are supported?

Currently, the only event RingCentral will transmit to your app is one relating to a user submitting a form contained by a message posted by the corresponding app. 

## Event structure

Each event transmitted to an outbound webhook URL will contain the following information:

* The app ID associated with the event. 
* The user who triggered the event.
* The chat in which the event was triggered.
* The message or post the event is associated with. 
* The payload of the event, e.g. data submitted by an end user

The payload of the event will contain the data submitted by the user in the form of a name/value pair map.

**Example event**

```js
{
    'uuid': 'abcdefg',
    'timestamp': '2016-03-10T18:07:52.534Z',
    'type': 'button_submit',
    'appId': 'abcdefg-123443-ghijklmnop',
    'user': {
        'id': 'abcdefg-1234',
		'firstName': 'Luke',
		'lastName': 'Skywalker',
		'accountId': '09283928373'
    },
	'conversation': {
        'id': 'abcdefg-1234',
        'type': 'group',
        'public': true,
        'name': 'Going-away party for Han'
	},
	'post': {
        'id': 'abcdefg-1234',
        'creationTime': '2016-03-10T18:07:52.534Z',
        'lastModifiedTime': '2016-03-10T18:07:52.534Z',
	},
	'data': [
	    { 'foo', 'bar' }
	]
}
```

### Post

| Attribute | Required? | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `id` | true | string | id of the post |
| `creationTime` | true | date | ISO 8601 format including timezone, for example 2016-03-10T18:07:52.534Z |
| `lastModifiedTime` | true | date | ISO 8601 format including timezone, for example 2016-03-10T18:07:52.534Z |

## Responding to interactive message events

* Return an error message to the user to let them know an action could not be performed. 
* Update the contents of the message.
* Post a new message in response.

Applications have 3 seconds in which to return a response. If a response is not returned in that timeframe, then TODO.

## Verifying the authenticity of an event

With every message posted to an Outbound Webhook URL, RingCentral will also transmit an HTTP header called `X-Glip-Signature`. The value of this header will be in the format of:

    sha1=<signature>
	
The signature is generated by computing the HMAC SHA1 hash of the receiving application's "shared secret" (generated for you when you created the app), and the event's payload. 

You can verify that RingCentral is the sender of an event by generated your own signature, and comparing it to the one contained in the HTTP header. 

### Handling long running or asynchronous processes

Some actions that a user intiates may produce the need to update the contents of the original message. Consider for example that a message is delivered to a software engineering team about a new software defect. One of the team members clicks a button to "claim" the issue - signaling to the rest of the team that they will fix the issue. When the message is first posted it shows the assignee as "Unassigned." After the user clicks the "Claim" button, the app wants to update the content of the message to show that the assignee is now "Chewbacca."

To accomplish this, use the Team Messaging REST API to fetch the contents of the corresponding post. This is done via the [Get Post](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Posts/readGlipPost) endpoint. Then use the [Update Post](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Posts/patchGlipPost) endpoint to modify the contents of the post/message. 

## Responses

Upon receiving an interactive messaging event, applications are expected to respond with a payload that will instruct RingCentral on how to respond to a user's input. If the response contains a message, that message will be displayed to the end user.

Apps should respond with an HTTP status code of 200, in order to acknowledge receipt of the message.

The structure of a response should conform to the following schema:

| Attribute | Required? | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `type` | false | enum | The type of response. Allowable values are:  "message". |
| `text` | false | string | The text of the response message. |
