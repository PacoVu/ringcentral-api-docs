RingCentral implements the [Adaptive Card framework](https://adaptivecards.io) version 1.3. Originally developed by Microsoft, this open source framework aids developers with the design and development of richly formatted and interactive messages common to team chat and messaging services.

This means that if you have developed integrations for Microsoft Teams, the level of effort associated with adapting your integration for RingCentral MVP is greatly reduced.
