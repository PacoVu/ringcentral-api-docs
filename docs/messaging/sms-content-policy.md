# RingCentral SMS/ MMS content policies

As a participating [TCR CSP](https://www.campaignregistry.com/), RingCentral is dedicated to providing the highest quality of service, while working to eliminate spam, phishing, and fraudulent messages.  To help ensure these goals are met, and in accordance with [CTIA messaging guidelines](https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/190719-CTIA-Messaging-Principles-and-Best-Practices-FINAL.pdf), the following policies apply to our SMS/ MMS solutions, whether sent via the RingCentral App, a third party provider, or via the API.




##Included Business SMS
As part of RingCentral MVPâ„¢, customers have access to SMS for person to person communications.  Use of Business SMS must comply with our Business SMS messaging guidelines and cannot be used for automated messaging (e.g. appointment reminders).  Included Business SMS must also adhere to RingCentral's [Terms of Service](https://www.ringcentral.com/legal/eulatos.html) and [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.ringcentral.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy.html).  **For automated messaging, including appointment reminders, notifications, chatbots, 2FA, etc, our High Volume SMS solution should be utilized.**

### RingCentral Business SMS messaging guidelines
* Send and receive no more than 15 to 60 messages per minute
* Send and receive no more than 1,000 messages in a 24 hour time period
* No more than 100 individual numbers per message
* No more than 25 repetitive messages
* 1:1 send/ receive ratio
* No more than 1 number used per person to send SMS


## High Volume and Toll-free SMS
For automated, repetitive, or mass volume SMS, RingCentral offers a High Volume SMS solution.  To help support your compliance with industry guidelines, your use of High Volume SMS is subject to additional requirements, which are detailed below.

### Opt-in/ user consent
Before sending an SMS message to any number you must have their express consent to do so.  It's important to note that implied consent is not considered sufficient for SMS, nor is purchasing a list of "users who have opted in to SMS."  A user must actively ask to receive SMS messages from you.  Remember, consent must be given for each campaign or message type you intend to send.

Consent may be obtained via a web form where it is clearly explained that a user is opting into SMS messages, or by having them send a message to your number.  It is highly recommended to use a double opt-in, confirming their consent via SMS and validating their number.

You must also log and track consent, and opt-ins and opt-outs.  In certain cases carriers may request proof that an individual has opted in including an overview of how your opt-in/ opt-out process works.

Failure to ensure opt-in may result in your number or service being blocked or suspended by mobile carriers or RingCentral.

### Opt-out
It is required that you provide a clear way for users to opt out of your SMS messages via text.  The CTIA guidelines provide clear keywords that must be honored for opt-out requests including STOP and UNSUBSCRIBE.  

To help manage opt-outs, High Volume SMS automatically prevents you from messaging users who have requested to opt-out, unless they opt back in using the provided keyword.

Toll-free SMS when used outside of High Volume SMS does not automatically manage opt-outs, and you will need to manage and track opt-out requests when not using High Volume SMS.  Similarly, you will need to manage opt-outs received through other methods, to avoid sending SMS to consumers that have opted out.

## Prohibited campaigns
While SMS provides a great way to engage your opted-in customers, there are limitations and restrictions in terms of what types of messages may be sent, and to the content of the messages.  The following campaigns are strictly prohibited across all of RingCentral's SMS solutions:

* Loan and mortgage advertisements
* Credit repair offers
* Debt relief offers
* Debt collection attempts
* Work from home advertisements
* Secret shopper advertisements
* Alcohol, tobacco, or firearms advertisements
* Campaigns that may be similar to the above

*Note: some campaigns are designed to engage existing customers (e.g. an update on your loan application), but are often prohibited because they are similar in nature.  For these types of campaigns, you may be able to receive an exemption by registering for a special TCR campaign.  Without this exemption, RingCentral is unable to allow these campaigns.

## Prohibited content
The following message content is also strictly prohibited and may result in your service being blocked or suspended by the carriers or RingCentral:

* Messages that engage in any illegal activity or otherwise violate our terms of service, including the acceptable use policy.
* Messages that engage in or promote, pornographic or adult entertainment, regardless of legality
* Messages that contain text or references to violence, hate speech, or otherwise engaging in threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, deceptive or fraudulent behavior
* Messages that contain text or otherwise reference substances defined as controlled substances under federal law, regardless of legality, including marijuana (cannabis) 
* Messages that contain third-party affiliate/lead generation links
* Messages that contain obfuscated links for the purpose of misleading the reader, or use links contrary to the expectation of the user based on the message text
* Messages that are structured to evade this policy or the policies of carriers (e.g. misspelling, uncommon capitalization, etc.)

RingCentral reserves the right to add to this list at any time or determine messages are prohibited at its discretion.
