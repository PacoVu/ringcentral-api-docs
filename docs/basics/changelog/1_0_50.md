#### Line of Business Analytics APIs

|Changed Methods|
|-----------|
| `POST /analytics/phone/performance/v1/accounts/~/calls/aggregate`|
| `POST /analytics/phone/performance/v1/accounts/~/calls/timeline?interval={Duration}`|

* `setup` as a new parameter for `additionalFilters` for both Aggreagate and Timeline API endpoints. `setup` is when the phone system is connecting to callee's device. This is when caller is calling via RingCentral App and system says "Please wait while I try to connect you" before the beeps starts.

* `TimeRange` is now updated. Previously, the minimum allowed timeFrom value was calculated by subtracting 6 calendar months from the current datetime. Now the limit is set at exactly `184 days` from the current datetime, making the validation explicit and independent of timezone differences.

* Aggregation formula changed for `Percent` aggregation type in the `Aggregate API`. Previously, values for Percent aggregation type were calculated by either dividing instances value of the counter by the all calls counter value or dividing sum of the seconds value of the timer by the all calls duration timer value. Now the formula depends on the meaning of the counter/timer. All of the following are applicable for both timers and counters, except for actions, as there is no timer for them.
