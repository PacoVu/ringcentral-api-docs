# Site Call Handling

If you are a company with operational functions spread across many sites, you need to be able to set individualized call handling rules according to their different time zones, company hours, language preferences, and more.

Site call handling is a set of configurations that determine how incoming calls to a site direct phone number (including calls via the site number i.e. MainCompanyNumber*SiteNumber) are routed and managed. These configurations can be tailored for different scenarios to ensure efficient call distribution and a consistent caller experience.

Site call handling rules can be defined separately based on the following conditions:

- Business Hours rule – Defines how calls are managed during the site's regular operating hours.
- After Hours rule – Applies when the business is closed (if business hours are not set to 24/7).
- Custom Schedules and Conditions rule  – Allows for special rules based on specific criteria, such as caller ID, called number, or custom time schedules (e.g., holidays or special events).

If a site has a custom rule that is configured and enabled, any incoming call directly to site will first be evaluated against the conditions defined in that rule. If all the conditions are met, the call will be routed according to the dispatching settings specified in the rule.

When multiple custom rules are active, the system will evaluate each rule in order. The first rule whose conditions match will determine how the call is handled. If none of the active custom rules match the incoming call, the system will fall back to evaluating the call against the Business Hours or After Hours rule, depending on the current date and time.

Site call handling rule can be configured to route incoming calls to the following destinations:

- IVR menu - Any IVR menu within the account
- User extension - A specific user extension
- Call queue - A call queue extension
- Voicemail - Must be a Message-only extension
- Announcement - Must be an Announcement-only extension
- Shared line - Must be a share line extension
- Limited extension - Must be a limited extension

## Update Site Business Hour and After Hour Call Handling Rules

By default, the system automatically creates a Business Hours rule and, if business hours are not set to 24/7, an After Hours rule. These rules are assigned the IDs `business-hours-rule` and `after-hours-rule`, respectively.

Developers can only update these rules configurations by making a PUT request to the following API endpoint, replacing [ruleId] with the appropriate rule identifier:

```http
PUT /restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/[SiteExtensionId]/answering-rule/[ruleId]
```

## Creating a Site Custom Call Handling Rule

Be mindful of the following when constructing a request to create a company custom answering rule:

* Provide a meaningful name for the rule using the `name` parameter.
* Set the `type` parameter as "Custom."
* Set the `enabled` parameter to True if the rule needs to be in effect immediately. Otherwise, set it to False.
* Specify one or more conditions (see below).
* Specify the action to take using the `callHandlingAction` field (see table below).
* Specify the `extension` and `greetings` parameters. [More details](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Call-Handling-Rules/createCompanyAnsweringRule)

Finally, make a POST request to the following endpoint:

`/restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/[SiteExtensionId]/answering-rule`

### Call Handling Actions

| Action | Description |
|-|-|
| `TransferToExtension` | Transfer the incoming call to an extension. Applied for IVR menu extension, call queue extension, user extension, , message-only extension, announcement-only extension, limited extension, shared line group. |

### Call Handling Conditions

The following parameters are used for specifying call handling conditions.

* `callers`: a list of callers' phone numbers or contact names
    * `callerId`:
    * `name`:
* `calledNumbers`:  a list of recipients' phone numbers
    * `phoneNumber`: a phone number belonging to the user/extension
* `schedule`: week day and time or time ranges or business hours and after hours parameters
    * `weeklyRanges`: week day and time ranges
    * `ranges`: date and time ranges
    * `ref`: "BusinessHours" or "AfterHours". Business hours can be set using the [Business Hours API Reference](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Business-Hours/updateUserBusinessHours)
