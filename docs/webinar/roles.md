# Understanding webinar attendee roles

People attending a webinar may be assigned one of several different roles. Each role comes with it a different set of entitlements and capabilities. These roles are:

| Role         | Description                                                                                                               |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Host**     | A webinar's host has full authority over all aspects of the webinar.                                                      |
| **CoHost**   | Co-hosts have the ability to change the role of other attendees, for example promoting an attendee to a panelist.         |
| **Panelist** | Panelists are allowed to participate directly in a webinar and can enable/disable their audio and video so that others can see and hear them. |
| **Attendee** | Attendees only have the ability to watch and/or listen to a webinar. Their microphone and video are fully disabled.       |
