# Introduction to the RingCentral Call Performance API (Beta)

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform - Call Performance API. Currently the API is in 'beta' release and you are one of the selected few invited to join the platform, try out the APIs and we look forward to your feedback. Please note that in future releases there will be changes to the APIs and this documenation, thus we highly recommend referring to this website time and again, specially the [release notes.](announcements/)

## Call Performance Report (PR) Overview & Use Cases

Performance Reports is a historical call performance analytics offering for RingCentral Office customers to help managers gain a comprehensive understanding of their teamâ€™s performance whether they are set up on call queues, user groups or as individual users.

The new performance reports offers a granular data set about call activities that can be accessed via an ad-hoc reporting tool on Analytics Portal or via a public API.

With new PR, there are two new metrics to assess for users, queues, groups, IVRs and sites.

1. Calls : aggregation of calls
2. Time Spent : aggregation of call durations

These metrics can then be further broken down for more detailed analysis. Available data are calls or time spent by:

- Origin (internal or external calls)
- Direction (Inbound or outbound calls)
- Answered and Not Answered calls 
- Types of calls answered & reasons for not answering 
- Time  spent by the caller in  phases of the call such as ringing, IVR prompt, live talk, hold etc.
- The times agents put the caller on hold, park, transferred during the call
- How the call ended, did it end after live talk at specified extn or got transferred, or sent to VM etc.
- Company Hours
- Various date and time ranges
