## Prerequisites

To use the Artificial Intelligence APIs, it is necessary to have a RingCentral account and a graduated application(with production credentials).

### 1. Creating an account

RingCentral AI API users belong to RingCentral accounts which can be either RingCentral MVP (Message, Video, Phone) or RingCentral Video (Message, Video) accounts.

If you are not a customer, [sign up for a free RingCentral Video account](https://app.ringcentral.com/signup).

!!! warning "Artificial AI APIs will not work with free Developer Accounts"
    These APIs will not work with "Free Developer Account". If you want to try these with a free account, you will have to create [RingCentral Video Pro free account](https://app.ringcentral.com/signup) and use that to login to Developer Console and create an application.

### 2. Creating an application

Accessing the RingCentral API and SDK requires an application with application credentials, including the applications OAuth 2.0 Client Id and optionally Client Secret.

Login to the [Developer Console](https://developers.ringcentral.com/login.html) and create an app. If you need help, follow our [quick start guide](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/basics/your-first-steps).

See the Developer Guide for information on several [authentication methods that your app can use](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/authentication).

### 3. Contact us to graduate your app to production

RingCentral applications need to be graduated before they can be used in the production environment. During this phase of our beta program, there is no developer sandbox support for RingCentral AI APIs. Therefore, all development will be done in production. 

To obtain production credentials please create a support case with your app's Client ID at [Create a help ticket](https://developers.ringcentral.com/support/create-case). While creating the case, select topic as "App graduation (obtaining production credentials)" and also mention that you will be using Artificial Intelligence APIs (AI) so that we can assign right permissions accordingly.
